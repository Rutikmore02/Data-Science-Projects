# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes COVID-19 data, including confirmed cases, deaths, and global happiness indices, to explore potential correlations and trends. The project is implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset Details
The project uses the following datasets:
- **covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv**: Contains data on confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide.
- **covid19_deaths_dataset.csv**: Includes records of COVID-19-related deaths.
- 
## Project Files
- **covid_19.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing data analysis, visualization, and insights.
- **Data Files**: CSV datasets used in the analysis.

## Key Analysis Steps
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization of COVID-19 Trends
4. Correlation Analysis with Happiness Index

## Requirements
